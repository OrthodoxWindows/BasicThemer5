# BasicThemer5
The most lightweight basic themer yet. Not only that, but also gets rid of any quick white flash that you might see when opening a program with BT2 or 3 as well as (as far as I know) seeing the DWM-composited theme flash when opening a program.

Almost all credit for this project goes to this guy https://github.com/spddl/disableDWMactivitys all I did was compile it so that there isn't a console window. It runs nicely in the background.
